# AGENT Shared Brain

This artifact is the shared memory for Architect/Builder/Tester sessions.

## Rules

- Keep edits scoped to the active intent and owned scope.
- Record verification failures as lessons.
- Prefer targeted patches over full-file rewrites.
- Re-plan when hooks return safety or governance errors.
